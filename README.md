# DataConveyer_ConvertCsvToFlat

DataConveyer_ConvertCsvToFlat is a sample console application to convert a CSV file to a flat (fixed-width field) file.
It uses Data Conveyer to perform the conversion.

The input file is expected to contain aircraft data along with IATA and ICAO codes. Like so:

```
"Airbus A320","320","A320"
"Boeing 747","747",\N
```

There is a sample input file (200+ lines, 8+KB) included in ...Data folder. The file is a copy of
[planes.dat](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/blob/master/data/planes.dat) file, which is
licensed under [Open Database License](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/blob/master/data/LICENSE).

Upon execution, the resulting output file will contan translations from the IATA code into the aircraft names (ICAO codes get discarded).
Like so:

```
320 - Airbus A320
747 - Boeing 747
```
